A main document can have multiple head and only 1 body element
Every web page must have a root element called the HTML element. All the other HTML elements must be nested within that root element. Usually, it can have a lang attribute which indicates the language of the HTML document.
The head element contains all the elements which do not contribute to the display area of the web page. Some of the common elements found in this section are title, meta, link and script elements. Each of these elements provides additional info on the web page. Some websites like search engines use the information inside the head element to understand the web page better.
The <body> HTML element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document.
Structural markup: the elements that you use to describe both headings and paragraphs
Semantic markup: provide extra information, such as where emphasis placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms and so on.
My work cycle for this assignment was first to watch the video Overviw on Youtube. Then I used the course website and at the end I used the example that was  provided.
