My experience learning  the HTML was hard at the begging because everything seemed so weird. The only thing that was old to me was the structure of the html. (html, head, title and body). However during the coursing I learned how to work on the rest of the stuff needed to complete and HTML and thus build a website. I think the hardest thing I had to do was adding a Video to my page.
I am a little nervous about the CSS because it is something new but I am also excited because my HTMLs are a little plain so far. But its good to start from the basics!


One of the challenges I had was being in control of my thoughts because these are the ones pulling us down. Happiness come downs to our thoughts,  our mindset, to our attitude, and we are 100% in control of what we are thinking. We might not be able to control how we feel in the moment but we can always control our thoughts which help us change the way we feel. I was able to do that but being in the present moment. I learned that's where happiness flourishes. The best way to do that was look for something in the moment that I can focus on and I appreciate. Even the smallest things. Like eating. As I am eating, instead of drifting to the future, or the past and thinking everything that have happened throughout the day, I try to slow down and be in that particular moment. Which means think about the food that I am eating and how good that might tastes, or even appreciate the company that I am eating this food with.
