This weekend I got up at 6:00 am because I had to run the M with the women's basketball team! I was very nervous at first but once I started going I was more and more confident! Even though I was very tired to the end I made it 4th to the top. It was a big challenge for me but I knew it was worth it, especially when I saw the vew!
