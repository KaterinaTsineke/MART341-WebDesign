It is a place where poeple can donate their bike and other bike relted equipment. These bikes can be used other regular use or for decoration if they are not in a good shape. However, people who are interested in getting they have to be wiliing to put some work into the bike they choose. They only cost $30 but you have the option to pay with 1 hour of volonteer work. Their main goal is to make Montana a safer place for the enviroment and limit the car use."
