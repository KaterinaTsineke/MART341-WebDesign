<<p> <<pre> Once upon a time there was a rose who was very proud of her beautiful looks. Her only disappointment was that she grew next to an ugly cactus. Every day, the rose would insult the cactus on his looks while the cactus stayed quiet.  All the other plants in the garden tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed by her own good looks.
<<p>One summer, the well present in the garden grew dry and there was no water for the plants. The rose began to wilt. She saw a sparrow dip her beak into the cactus for some water. Though ashamed, she asked the cactus if she too could have some water. The kind cactus readily agreed and they both got through the tough summer as friends.</p>
Moral: Never judge someone by the way they look</pre> </p>
